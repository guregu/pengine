[Pengines: Prolog Engines](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/pengines.html%27)) client for Go.
Pengines's motto is "Web Logic Programming Made Easy". This library lets you query SWI-Prolog from Go and from [ichiban/prolog](https://github.com/ichiban/prolog), a Prolog interpreter written in Go.

**Development Status**: beta. Feedback and contributions welcome!

## Usage

This library supports both the JSON and Prolog format APIs. Additionally, an RPC predicate for ichiban/prolog is provided.

### Configuration

```go
client := pengine.Client{
    // URL of the pengines server, required.
    URL: "http://localhost:4242/pengine",

    // Application name, optional.
    Application: "pengines_sandbox",
    // Chunk is the number of query results to accumulate in one response. 1 by default.
    Chunk: 10,
    // SourceText is Prolog source code to load (optional, currently only supported for the JSON format).
    SourceText: "awesome(prolog).\n",
    // SourceURL specifies a URL of Prolog source for the pengine to load (optional).
    SourceURL: "https://example.com/script.pl",
}
```

### JSON API

`client.Ask` returns an `Answers[Solutions]` iterator, but you can use the generic `pengine.Ask[T]` function to use your own types.

```go
answers, err := client.Ask(ctx, "between(1,6,X)")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
var got []json.Number
for as.Next() {
	cur := as.Current()
	x := cur["X"]
	got = append(got, x.Number)
}
// got = {"1", "2", "3", ...}
if err := answers.Error(); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

You can also use `client.Create` to create a pengine and `Ask` it later. If you need to stop a query early or destroy a pengine whose automatic destruction was disabled, you can call `client.Close`.

### Prolog API

`client.AskProlog` returns `ichiban/prolog/engine.Term` objects. This uses the ichiban/prolog parser to handle results in the Prolog format. Use this for the most accurate representation of Prolog terms, but be aware that the parser does not support all of SWI's bells and whistles.

You can also call `pengine.Term.Prolog()` to get Prolog terms from the JSON results, but they might be lossy in terms of Prolog typing.

#### Warning about Unicode atoms

SWI-Prolog's defaults around Unicode cause errors for our Prolog parser at the moment, so we need to tweak the configuration.
  - We can't handle SWI's `\uXXXX` Unicode [escapes](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=charescapes).
    - This can interfere with unification of query results and cause unexpected "no solutions found" errors.

Luckily, Pengines makes it easy for us to customize the result formatter and fix this. Just define a [`pengines:write_result/3`](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=pengines%3Awrite_result/3) hook for the `prolog` format on your Pengines server.

Here's an example of a working Pengines configuration:

```prolog
pengines:write_result(prolog, Event, _) :-
    format('Content-type: text/x-prolog; charset=UTF-8~n~n'),
    write_term(Event,
               [ quoted(true),
                 quote_non_ascii(true),            % ðŸ‘ˆ
                 character_escapes_unicode(false), % ðŸ‘ˆ
                 ignore_ops(true),
                 fullstop(true),
                 blobs(portray),
                 portray_goal(pengines:portray_blob),
                 nl(true)
               ]).
```

### RPC for ichiban/prolog

You can call remote pengines from [ichiban/prolog](https://github.com/ichiban/prolog), a Go Prolog, as well.

[`pengine_rpc/3`](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=pengine_rpc/3) mostly works like its SWI-Prolog counterpart.
Not all the options are implemented yet, but it seems to work OK!

```go
interpreter.Register3("pengine_rpc", pengine.RPC)
```

```prolog
:- pengine_rpc('http://localhost:4242/pengine', between(1,50,X), [chunk(10)]), write(X), nl.
% 1 2 3 4 ...
```

## Tests

Currently the tests are rather manual:

```prolog
% from swipl
consult(example_server).
```

```bash
# from OS terminal
go test -v
```

Change the pengines server URL used by the tests with the `--pengines-server` command line flag.
